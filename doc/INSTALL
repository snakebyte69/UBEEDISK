The "n.n.n" is the version number:

ubeedisk-n.n.n.tar.gz       : Source files
ubeedisk-n.n.n-win32.exe    : Binary installer for Windows

ubeedisk-n.n.n-portable.zip : Binary package combining Windows and Unix

Installation
============
For Windows systems the binary installer EXE, binary ZIP, or the Portable  
binary ZIP distribution may be used.  The later is a combination of Windows
and Unix binaries.

All binaries have LibDsk, zlib and bz2lib statically linked in.  Linux
binaries have other dependencies that must also be met.

On Windows, ubeedisk may be installed to any location you want including a
USB drive, if installing to a systems area then you may need to have
administration rights to install and run the program.

EXE file
--------
1. Run the installer and follow the directions.
2. To access floppy drives on Windows 2000 and above requires a special
   floppy driver to be installed. This is available from here:
   http://simonowen.com/fdrawcmd/
3. Follow the install instructions under 'ALL SYSTEMS'.

WIN32 ZIP file
--------------
1. If you plan on installing over an existing installation then save the
   current ubeedisk.ini file if this has been customised.
2. Unzip the Windows ubeedisk-n.n.n-win32.zip binary distribution to a
   location you wish to use.  If you have a previous installation then you
   can just unzip over the top of the other.
3. To access floppy drives on Windows 2000 and above requires a special
   floppy driver to be installed. This is available from here:
   http://simonowen.com/fdrawcmd/
4. Follow the install instructions under 'ALL SYSTEMS'.

UBUNTU DEB (DEBIAN)
-------------------
1. Use a package installer of your choice. To use the dpkg installer from a
   command line:
   $sudo dpkg -i ubeedisk_n.n.n_i386.deb
   or from the desktop double click on the deb file from 'File browser'
2. Follow the configuration instructions under 'UNICES FLOPPY CONFIGURATION'.
3. Follow the install instructions under 'ALL SYSTEMS'.

RPM (general)
-------------
The RPM package should install on most RPM based Linux distributions. 

1. First you may like to do a test install as root, this won't actually
   install any files but may show any potential problems before installing:
   # rpm -i --test ubeedisk-n.n.n-2.i386.rpm
   To do the real install as root:
   # rpm -i ubeedisk-n.n.n-2.i386.rpm
2. Follow the configuration instructions under 'UNICES FLOPPY CONFIGURATION'.
3. Follow the install instructions under 'ALL SYSTEMS'.

TGZ (Slackware)
---------------
Binary tar compressed package intended for Slackware or any Linux x86
installation, this contains the installed directory tree (./usr/...) and
files.

1. Install the package as root:
   #/sbin/installpkg ubeedisk-n.n.n.tgz
2. Follow the configuration instructions under 'UNICES FLOPPY CONFIGURATION'.
3. Follow the install instructions under 'ALL SYSTEMS'.

PORTABLE ZIP (Windows/Unix binary(s))
-------------------------------------
Binary package intended for portable R/W media installations (i.e. USB flash
drives). Start-up scripts provided allows running Windows or Unix versions of
uBeeDisk from the same drive without the need to install under the host
system.  The Unix build of uBeeDisk may also be run from some 'Live CDs'.

1. Unzip the ubeedisk-n.n.n-portable.zip binary distribution to a location
   you wish to use.  If you have a previous installation then you can just
   unzip over the top of the other.
2. As a user under Windows or Unix and under a command line change directory
   to the installed location.
3. To access floppy drives on Windows 2000 and above requires a special
   floppy driver to be installed. This is available from here:
   http://simonowen.com/fdrawcmd/
4. Follow the configuration instructions under 'UNICES FLOPPY CONFIGURATION'.
5. Follow the install instructions under 'ALL SYSTEMS'.

UNICES FLOPPY CONFIGURATION
---------------------------
On Unix systems you must have R/W access rights to the floppy disks, this
may just work out of the box or you will need to make some changes.  How
this is done can vary, just changing R/W access bits may not work on systems
that use 'udev', typically floppy devices /dev/fdx belong to the floppy
group.  As 'root' you can add your user name (or knoppix, etc.) to the
floppy group found in /etc/group with an editor:

floppy:x:25:knoppix

Just add your user name to the end of the line and don't change the number
as it will probably be different.  After you have saved the file you must
log out then log in again for the changes to take affect.

ALL SYSTEMS
-----------
If a 'ubeedisk.ini' file is required it should be placed into the 'ubeedisk'
directory on Windows and portable installs.  On Unices (non-portable) the
file should be placed into a '.ubeedisk' directory in the user's home
account.

The 'ubeedisk.ini.sample' supplied in the distribution's 'config' directory
can be copied across as 'ubeedisk.ini' and changed as required.

SOURCE BUILD/INSTALL
--------------------
You will need to have a GCC build environment set up for the native build
and if you want to cross compile you will also need mingw.

Untar the source distribution into a normal user work area logged in as
a standard user.

LibDsk
------
LibDsk is a dependency and must be built in as a dynamic or static library.
This distribution includes a patch for libdsk which is highly recommended.

This patch greatly improves the 'remote' type serial speed (including USB
serial).  Patches and how to apply notes are located in
'ubee512-n.n.n/patches/libdsk-1.2.1x-ubee.patch.zip'

uBeeDisk
--------
$ tar -xzf ubeedisk-n.n.n.tar.gz    (n.n.n is the version number)
$ cd ubeedisk-n.n.n/src

$ make

If you want to cross compile the windows version:
$ make ming32

Install the files
-----------------
As root:
# make install

or if you use sudo (ubuntu) you could use:
$ sudo make install

Un-install the files
--------------------
As root:
# make uninstall
