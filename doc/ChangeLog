uBeeDisk v4.0.1

* amendments to options.c to solve buffer over/under-run trap
* amendments to Makefile to allow conditional compilation on MacOS

4 February 2017 - uBee
----------------------
uBeeDisk v4.0.0

New for this release:
* Added --pskew, --pskew0 and --pskew1 physical skewing options.
* Added --cacher and --cachew options to enable disable read/write caching
  if the device supports it.
* Added --gapset option.  This allows just about any custom floppy disk
  format to be created on devices that support it.
* Added --erase option to completely erase tracks with a set value for
  devices that may support it.
* Added special low level 'erase-40' and 'erase-80' internal formats for
  track eraser for devices that are able to support it.
* Added a 'dos' detection module.  By using --detect=dos it allows disk
  imaging of virtually any IBM DOS, Atari ST, MSX-DOS disk or any other
  disks that use the same disk structure automatic.
* Added a built in Little Big Board (lbb_77dshd) format with GAP values.
* Added a 'dos', 'atari', 'msx', 'applix' macros to 'ubeedisk.ini.sample'. 
  The existing 'msdos*' and 'atari*' macros should be considered obsolete
  for reading purposes.  'dos' will try to detect 'atari' and 'msx' but can
  be forced by using the macro names.
* Added separate --datarateip and --datarateop input/output options.
* Added separate --fmip and --fmop input/output options.
* Added separate --autorateip and --autorateop input/output options.
* Added a --confv option for use in ubeedisk.ini file to set script version.
* Added Warning messages if the config file can't be found or if the config
  file is an old version.
* Added a ATTR_CACHER_OFF and ATTR_CACHEW_OFF attribute option that may be
  used by an internal format definition to disable read/write caching in
  devices that supports it.  May be overriden using the --cacher=on or
  --cachew=on options.
* Added two low level ERASE macros to 'ubeedisk.ini.sample'. These being
  'erase-40' and 'erase-80' which make use of the new --erase option.
* Added output file name substitution characters. See README for the full
  details. These are very useful when using the new DOS module.
* Added conditional options support mainly intended for scripting usage. 
  These are used to set system variables for various systems so that
  'ubeedisk.ini.sample' can now handle different script settings
  automatically.
* Added built-in and environment variable support mainly intended for
  scripting usage.
* Added various short simple macros 'scan', 'copy', 'format', etc to
  'ubeedisk.ini.sample' instead of having to type in --disk=job.

Changes:
* Changes to format modules that required physical skewing on disk is now
  implemented differently.
* All jobs now return an error status that may be used in scripts.
* A major overhaul concerning data rates and MFM/FM recording modes for
  input and output so that input and output can use different data rates and
  recording modes.
* Able to exit when prompted for a disk description by entering an '*' on a
  line by itself.
* Removed the --buffering mode option. Use --cacher and --cachew instead.
* Changes to the information in the 'info' file output.
* Major changes/additions to 'ubeedisk.ini.sample' to detect operating
  system and set variables for PC floppy drives and remote serial use.
* Some formats defined in 'ubeedisk.ini.sample' now set the internal format.

Fixed:
* LibDsk build for Linux was using wrong build prefix so was being built
  against an older LibDsk build.  Should now be LibDsk-1.4.2
* Set internal formats 'skew_val' and  'skew_ofs' where -1 was being used to
  the actual values wanted.  This means the values will not use the default
  values any longer.  The default values are 2 and 1 so was not an issue but
  not as originally intended.
* Changed datarate scan order in disk_scan() and disk_speed() as a 360Kb
  disk in 1.2Mb drive may return the incorrect value if scanned as SD first.
* Some minor fixes, removal of obsolete code and code tidying.

16 November 2016 - uBee
-----------------------
uBeeDisk v3.1.0

New for this release:
* Compiled up against the LibDsk-1.4.2 library which now provides IMD and
  TRS-80 'JV3'image support along with other changes since 1.3.5.  See the
  LibDsk ChangeLog.
* LibDsk DSK and RAW drivers do not support the --iside and --oside options
  and may only work for floppy access?  Provide a work around if setting
  --iside or --oside and not supported by the driver.
* Added --nofill option to skip 0xe5 fill after the 'finish' point.
* Added auto input/output type setting for '.imd' images.
* Added a hint to one of the fdc_gap_calc() error messages.
* Added Knight 'k80sssd128' format (5.25" SS SD 80T 80x18x128 b/s).
* Added Knight 'k80dsdd512' format (5.25" DS DD 80T 80x10x512 b/s).
* Updated --help option for the above changes.
* Added Little Big Board (lbb_77dshd) macro to ubeedisk.ini.sample.
* Added Datamax 8000 (datamax8000sd) macro to ubeedisk.ini.sample.
* Added a 'ibm3740ds' macro to ubeedisk.ini.sample.
* Added a special 'ds80sp' DS80 disk format variation to ubeedisk.ini.sample.
* Added 'st-dsxx', etc. macros to ubeedisk.ini.sample.  These may be used
  for extracting system tracks to a raw file.

Fixed:
* Fixed the 'knight80' entry to use a head offset value of 128.
* Fixed Makefile 'r' permissions for Unices installs.
* Fixed density description for IBM3740 format in ubeedisk.ini.sample.

28 February 2015 - uBee
-----------------------
uBeeDisk v3.0.0

New for this release:
* Added dynamic GAP calculations which will be used by PC floppy output and
  disk images that support storing the value, static values may still
  be defined and will be used instead except for Floppyio units.
* Replaced specific disk format handling code with xdg.*_cb() call-back
  functions which are defined in the disk support modules if needed.
* Added checking when opening input/output for formats that use a variable
  track size that the disk type specified is suitable.
* Added better error reporting to the disk write section to report the first
  10 write errors and removed the verbose level controlled error reporting
  associated with it.
* Added --sfmode option to allow --start and --finish to refer to cylinders
  or logical tracks, default mode is cylinders as before but logical tracks
  mode provides finer control.
* Added new 'info' file entries for the input/output drive types used.
* Added --sideoffs option for control over sector side information.
* Added --fdwa1, --fdwa2 and --fdwa options to provide control over the
  floppy work-around code.
* Added 'serial:' remote file detection to auto set the type to remote.
* Added --it and --ot options as non ambiguous option names for --itype and
  --otype as these had been in common use and could have become broken if
  other --it* or --ot* options were ever added.
* Added --ifile and --ofile to be consistent with type options names.
* Added Super-80 's80cpm1' CP/M 80T format disks.
* Added Amust Compak DS DD 80T 1x16x256, 79x5x1024 b/s 5.25" disks.
* Added Excalibur4 DS DD 80T 80x5x1024 b/s 5.25" disks.
* Added Dreamdisk 'dds40' and 'dds80' formats using new side offset support.
* Added 'ds40s' and 'ss40s' 40x18x128 b/s 5.25" SD formats.
* Added some general purpose built in formats (see --lformat).
* Compiled up against the LibDsk-1.3.5 library which now provides write
  support for CopyQM disk images along with many other changes since 1.2.1
  released in 2008-01-23. See the LibDsk ChangeLog.
* Added Raspberry Pi 'deb', 'rpm' and 'tgz' binary distribution builds.

Changes:
* Changes to remove the auto 'mbee' detection setting, the user must now
  specify it on the command line if detection is required.
* Changes to disk scan process for faster scanning on each track.
* Suppressed repetitive disk format selection information.
* Replaced the GNU MD5 code with later version and changes as required.
* Changes to source code now makes adding new modules easier.
* The --flags option has been deprecated.
* Changes to --lformat to double the width of the left column output.
* Changes to make --ltype option provide better information.
* Removed external Gamma, Applix, 60, 3030, ds40u and ds80u formats from
  'ubeedisk.ini.sample' as these formats are now built-in.

Fixed:
* Fixed a bug introduced in v2.2.0 where copying RAW to DSK (and possibly
  other input types) failed to write on Head 1 of the disk for formats that
  use side 0 on both sides of the disk.
* Fixed segmentation error when a disk error is being logged and the batch
  mode (--count option) was also in affect.
* Fixed track formatting for formats that use physically skew sectors so
  that skew formatting only applied if the output is a floppy type.  Disk
  images will be in sequential order.
* Fixed disk sidedness feature as did nothing before.
* Fixed a bug in ubeedisk.c in function interface_support().
* Fixed disk scan when a 400/800 kb DD disk in 1.2 Mb drive to report as 300
  and not 250 kHz and for FM disks to report correct data rate.

1 January 2014 - uBee
---------------------
uBeeDisk v2.3.1

New for this release:
* Added unkown 'ds40u' and 'ds80u' formats to 'ubeedisk.ini.sample'.

Fixed:
* Fixed format_track() where Microbee DS80 DSK images were not using the
  correct sector numbers when format_track_range() was being used for
  partial formatting of a disk (i.e.  when using the --start and --finish
  options).  DS80 was incorrectly using sectors 1-10 instead of 21-30 for
  data tracks.  Any formats that make use of xdg.dg_secbase2c to specify
  data cylinders start point will now use the sector base value held in
  xdg.dg_secbase2s.

5 June 2013 - uBee
------------------
uBeeDisk v2.3.0

New for this release:

Changes:
* Added Floppyio 'fioxx' macros to 'ubeedisk.ini.sample'.
* Added North Star Horizon 'nshs' disk macro to 'ubeedisk.ini.sample'.
* Windows distribution has all text files using CRLF format with '.txt' added.

Fixed:
* Changes to reset_input_drive_and_settings() to exit if not a PC Floppy
  disk as input type.  This function was causing Remote time-out errors
  under Linux and possibly Win32 and the code should not be necessary. 
  Added error reporting and exit(EXIT_FAILURE) at various points.
* Changes to close_files() to report any dsk_close() errors.
* Fixed help in ub-xsxx-makexxx.bat files (fixed template), thanks langra.
* Various compiler warning fixes.

16 May 2012 - uBee
------------------
uBeeDisk v2.2.0

New for this release:
* Added a user prompt if the destination file already exists allowing the
  file to be written over or skipped.
* Added the Pause menu to disk scanning, format and speed tests.
* Disable exiting using ctrl-C, ctrl-\ and ctrl-Z under Unix systems and
  ctrl-C under windows as can leave floppy in an unstable state.
* Added the 'ds8b' format to the Microbee formats module and 'mbee-ds8b'
  to 'ubeedisk.ini.sample'.
* Added additional Honeysoft 'hs350-80' and 'hs525-80' formats where more
  than 40 tracks have been used (not auto detected).

Changes:
* Changes to 'remote' type to allow the new USB Floppyio external floppy
  interface to use full capabilities.
* Smarter detection of 'remote' capabilities.
* Changes to --forceside option to allow forcing any sector header side
  values using new 00, 01, 10 and 11 parameters.
* Changes to the user Abort selection when writing to a floppy disk now acts
  immediately.
* Changes made to the drive head clean process to only run if input is a
  floppy drive.
* Improved Unix key checking to prevent unwanted key echoing.
* LibDsk call back reporting requires setting verbose level 2 or higher.
* The Slax build has been removed from the distribution packages.

Fixed:
* Fixed the format track part of a disk copy to only use the disk format's
  'side1as0' value when the read source type does not support a fully
  implemented psecid function.
* Fixed remote 'serial' on Unix builds to allow serial to use full potential
  speed (LibDsk library fix).
* Added --side1as0 to the 'mbee-ds40' macro in 'ubeedisk.ini.sample'

9 October 2011 - uBee
---------------------
uBeeDisk v2.1.0

New for this release:
* The disk detection has been broken up into modules allowing other disk
  types to be added easily.
* Added Applix 1616/OS disk detection module with 80-83 track detection
  support.
* Added Applix 1616/OS disk skewing when writing tracks.
* Added Microbee detection module.
* Added an FM disk detection module and some 8" disk formats.
* Added Abort option to the Pause menu.
* Added c5h0s0_525 format to the Microbee module. (not tested)

Changes:
* Changes to the --buffering option to take new arguments as this option is
  now used to change the buffering mode as buffering is always in use.  The
  default mode for buffering is set to normal.
* Changes to make reading of all sectors use sector skewing regardless of
  the buffering mode.  The buffering mode (quiet) is only different in that
  it does not do any console output and minimal processing between sector
  reads which might cause sectors to be missed.
* Changes to read_sector_retry() to report logical and physical sectors and
  report extra information if --verbose=2 is also specified.

Fixed:
* Fixed the FLAGS_C5H0S0 format which was broken in v2.0.0.
* Fixed recovery option if drive door is opened when reading a sector and
  changed the action for the Retry method.
* Fixed the copy process to write out complete info file when the copy
  process is aborted.  This places an 'X' into each unread sector location
  within the info file.
* Fixed --start and --finish options override track start/finish.

1 October 2011 - uBee
---------------------
uBeeDisk v2.0.0

New for this release:
* Added 'speed' argument to --disk option. This may be used to test and
  adjust the RPM setting of the spindle motor.
* Added 'clean' argument to --disk option. This may be used to clean the
  drive heads using a special cleaning disk.
* Added track --buffering option which when enabled can greatly speed up the
  copy process by using a skew of 2 on reads read.
* Added --skew and --skew-ofs options.
* Added --scanhead option to determine head range for the scanning process.
* Added --ignore-errors option. This will ignore all errors when using the
  Interactive error handling mode.
* Added --flags option to set special disk format flags.
* Added keyboard detection while copying is in progress, this allows the
  operator to pause the process.  A paused copy will display the Pause menu
  which allows resuming, drive head cleaning using a special disk, manual
  cleaning and the required error handling mode to be selected.
* Added error 'Mode' handling selection to the Interactive menu.
* Added 'Skip' option to the Interactive menu to allow ignoring all the
  remaining errors that are encountered for the current disk.
* Added 'Clean' heads option to the Interactive menu to allow drive head
  cleaning using a special disk.
* Added Microbee Gamma, Applix 1616 and ibm3740 built-in formats.
* Added check to disallow writing to floppy, remote, etc. if any GAP values
  are set to 0.
* A major overhaul of 'ubeedisk.ini.sample' to simplify disk definitions and
  to fix problems with some existing formats, new disk formats and scan
  sections have also been added.  All users should update their
  'ubeedisk.ini' file based on this new file.

Changes:
* Disk scanning now reports LibDsk error when a track can't be scanned.
* Unattended mode is now disabled by default but may be switched in or out
  while copying is in progress.
* When reading the first sector some drives error out as it seems there is
  not enough delay after the head is homed so for the first read error we
  now do an unreported retry.
* Changes to error handling prompts.
* Changed the --verbose option to take values greater than 1.
* Changed all compiler directives of '__MINGW32__' to 'WIN32'.
* Changed 'KHz' to 'kHz'.

Fixed:
* Fixed the disk.oside setting in override_values(), was using wrong
  condition variable of disk.iside instead of disk.oside which meant the
  output side was set wrong when disk.iside is not the default unless
  disk.oside had also been set with an option.
* Fixed double stepping from being enabled on auto detect for input/output
  drives even when --idstep=off or --odstep=off was specified.  Also now
  only sets if disk is less than 70 tracks.
* Fixed disk scanning where some disks produced a non recoverable error
  which prevented all tracks from being scanned successfully.
* Previously when attempting to read a floppy disk without a disk in the
  drive would result in an input/output error.  This error can now be
  recovered from.
* Fixed --side1as0 information in help.

12 June 2011 - uBee
-------------------
uBeeDisk v1.6.2

Fixed:
* HDD formats 'hd0' and 'hd1' incorrectly documented in --help.  Replaced
  with 'teac' and 'mscribe' respectively in help for the --format option.

5 March 2011 - uBee
-------------------
uBeeDisk v1.6.1

Fixed:
* Fixed reading of Honeysoft disks when using a disk driver type that does
  not support 'dsk_psecid' (i.e 'remote' and FDS.COM on the Microbee
  computer).

3 December 2010 - uBee
----------------------
uBeeDisk v1.6.0

New for this release:
* Added Microbee hard disk formats 'teac - Microbee TEAC HDD 10MB 306
  cylinders, 4 heads, 17 sect/track' and 'mscribe - Microbee Miniscribe HDD
  10MB 612 cylinders, 2 heads, 17 sect/track' to the built in formats.
* Added Microbee hard disk 'mbee-teac', 'mbee-mscribe' and floppy disk
  'mbee-ds40', 'mbee-ss80' sections to 'ubeedisk.ini.sample'.

Fixed:
* Fixed Windows scripts 'ub-*-makedsk.bat' and 'ub-*-makeraw.bat' scripts
  where a $1 was used instead of %1.

8 July 2010 - uBee
------------------
uBeeDisk v1.5.0

Changes:
* The retry1 value when copying now defaults to 30 or to 1 if the input type
  is set to 'remote'.  The --retry-l1 option has been fixed and can now be
  used to override this.  A low value for 'remote' is required as too many
  retries were being used on native hardware when it wasn't really needed and
  slowing up the process on bad sectors.
* The retry1 value when scanning now defaults to 5 or to 1 if the input type
  is set to 'remote'.
* The --retry-l1 option can now be used to override the retry1 value when
  the 'scan' command is used.

Fixed:
* The retry1 value was always being set to 30 when copying regardless of the
  --retry-l1 setting and has now been fixed.

6 April 2010 - uBee
-------------------
uBeeDisk v1.4.0

New for this release:
* Added --verbose option to set console output reporting level. The default
  level is 1 which makes all console messages active like previous versions. 
  If set to 0 then only error messages, interaction prompts and processes
  intended to convey information will be output.
* Added batch and shell scripts for common tasks involving disk images.
* Added SLAX package to the distribution packages.

Changes:
* No disk description prompting if the output type is not a disk image, this
  includes types: floppy, ntwdm, remote, rcpmfs.
* Added more types to be excluded when creating 'info', and '.err' files.
  Only output types that are images will be able to create these files.
* Option parameters converted to lower case for --itype, --otype, --format,
  --datarate, --detect and --disk.

Fixed:
* Fixed problems with sector ID, read and write functions failing because of
  unsupported functions in the driver type in use.  The changes will make
  use of an alternative function appropriate for the driver to be used
  instead.  This has fixed issues when using the 'raw' and 'remote' driver
  as an input and possibly other driver types.

17 February 2010 - uBee
-----------------------
uBeeDisk v1.3.0

Changes:
* Added data rate and encoding mode detection and reporting to the disk
  scanning process.
* Changes to the disk scanning command so that scanning will only occur on
  one side of the disk when specifying an --iside option.  If not specified
  then both sides are scanned.
* Major rewrite of the Makefile.

Fixed:
* Fixed a problem when using batch mode (--count=n) the seeked count in the
  unattended mode was not being set back to 0 for the next copy operation.
* Fixed the disk copy process to set 'mbee' detection based on input and not
  output driver types.
* Fixed the disk info command.

6 February 2010 - uBee
----------------------
uBeeDisk v1.2.0

New for this release:
* Added --retry-l1 and --retry-l2 retry options.  The existing --retry
  option is the same as option --retry-l2.
* Added --unattended option to enable/disable automatic handling of errors. 
  This mode is now enabled by default.  See the global section of the
  ubeedisk.ini.sample if disabled is required by default.
* Added --unattended-rab option to set number of sector errors allowed
  before aborting the copy process when the unattended mode is in use.
* Added --unattended-rps option to set number of retries per sector allowed
  when the unattended mode is in use.
* Added --unattended-seek option to set the maximum number of error seeks
  per disk read allowed when the unattended mode is in use.
* Added another option to the recovery options: '[T] ReTry (don't seek T0)'
* Added Atari ST 80T Single/Double sided and some MSDOS formats to
  ubeedisk.ini.sample.
* Added --diskdesc option so that a disk description can be passed.
* Added --diskdescf option for a disk description contained in a file.
* Added --force option to bypass confirming requested actions.
* Added --append-error to append the error log (if created) to the 'info'
  file instead of creating an error file.
* Added a win32 binary installer to the distribution.

Changes:
* Changed method used for reading sectors as was causing many soft retries
  to show up in the '.info' file and likely to have caused problems on some
  disks because of a too low retry value at the LibDsk level.
* Disabled error checking for disk writing as this was failing when writing
  to disk images following certain disk read errors.  This will be looked at
  further at another time.
* Changes and additions to the generated '.info' files.
* Changed error logging to now go to a '.err' file by default unless
  --append-error has been specified.

10 March 2009 - uBee
--------------------
uBeeDisk v1.1.0

New for this release:
* Added error report logging, this is appended to the info file.
* Added --log option to set the level of logging for read errors.

Changes:
* Transient errors (including Unknown Error) are now processed just like any
  other disk errors. The error count now also increments when one of these
  errors occurs and the user will be prompted for action when the retry
  counter expires.

Fixed:
* Sector map was updated but the error count was not being incremented on a
  transient read error and has been corrected.

27 December 2008 - uBee
-----------------------
uBeeDisk v1.0.0

Initial release:
Copies disks and images from one to another.  This program was developed to
archive Microbee disk images from floppy disks and to write back to floppy,
other disk formats can be added.  The intended audience is mainly for users
of computer emulators.  As the program makes use of the 'LibDsk' library
there are many options for image types.  The program provides some data
recovery methods along with 'info' files for each disk image file created. 
An 'info' file contains information about the disk image, a status map of
all sectors read from the disk and an MD5 stamp of the associated disk
image.
