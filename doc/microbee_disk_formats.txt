Microbee Disk Formats
=====================
4 February 2010 - uBee

This document describes the physical layout of most of the common disk
formats used by the Microbee computer.

The Microbee uses a Western Digital WD2793 disk controller on later models
for formatting and accessing floppy disks.

Low level format
----------------
The low level format method employed on disks allows for reading/writing
sectors on normal PC floppy controllers.

There is a problem with the original formatted disks that causes a problem
to FDC controllers if not taken into account.  The native format programs
used the value of 0 on both sides of the disk in the sector headers.  This
issue is usually the 'show stopper' when trying to access Microbees disks on
modern hardware.

The WD2793 controller ignored the Side value so was never a problem on the
Microbee hardware.  The side issue is present on all native DS40 and DS80
disks. 3rd party formatting tools usually wrote the correct side numbers for
both sides of the disk.

The side issue must be considered a possibility on ALL Microbee disks.

Sector numbers
--------------
Sector numbers are always numbered 1-10 on the reserved (system) tracks and
this format is also normally used for the data tracks.  The sectors are
written in sequential order, no skewing is done at the low level.

One of the formats (DS80) differs for the data area where sector numbers
21-30 are used. The reason for this was likely to have been a protection
measure to stop SS80 and DS80 disks becoming corrupted if the wrong disk was
placed into the machine.

To make a disk image from a DS80 disk format requires that the reserved
track's sectors 1-10 and data sectors 21-30 to be taken into account.

Data skewing
------------
Skewing of the data tracks for all disks is used and was normally done by
the operating system in use.  The typical skewing used is one of the
following:

SKEW1:  2,  5,  8,  1,  4,  7, 10,  3,  6,  9
SKEW2: 22, 25, 28, 21, 24, 27, 30, 23, 26, 29

Copy protected formats
----------------------
These following formats have been worked out from looking at some sample
disks, Type 1 is the most common format used.  There are possibly other
protection formats in use.

Type 1
------
A common method employed for some copy protected disks was to use a mixture
of 512 and 1024 byte sectors.  From all the disks I have seen that use this
protection method the layout is consistent.

The disks all appear to be single side, double density (MFM) types, and use
only the first 40 cylinders regardless of being 3.5" or 5.25" media. The
first 5 cylinders (0 - 4) use 10 x 512 sectors and the remaining 35
cylinders (5 - 39) use 5 x 1024 sectors.  The track sectors are numbered
starting from 1.

Type 2
------
I have found one disk that uses this method and I'm assuming it's not a bad
disk as it appears to run correctly.  The disk layout is the same as the
SS80 format shown below but cylinder #5 has sectors numbered from 0 - 9
instead of 1 - 10.  Sector #0 can't be read without error, skipping reading
this sector and writing back sector #0 (with any data) as a good sector
seems to work fine.

Low level formatting
====================
The format shown below is typical for a Microbee 10 s/t double density floppy
disk (From the FORMAT40.COM Format program).

Microbee disks used Single and Double Density IBM formats.  The information
presented here is for double density disks and is a variation on the 'IBM
System 34 Format'.  Refer to a WD279x data sheet.

Refer to a WD279x data sheet.

DATA BITS = RATE / RPS

DATA BITS = number of bits written in one disk revolution (data per track)
RATE      = data rate bits per second (300,000)
RPS       = revolutions per second (6)

50,000 = 300,000 / 6

6250 bytes per track (50,000 / 8) is the nominal amount of data per track.

* Typically sector numbers 1-10 are used except for data tracks on DS80
  disks where the sector are numbered 21-30.  The sectors are written in
  sequential order.

* Microbee native format programs have SIDE set to 0 when writing side 0 or
  side 1 of the disk.  3rd party programs may use SIDE=1 for side 1.

* Dreamdisk formats use bit 7 of the SIDE value to indicate if the disk is
  double sided.  If the bit is set the disk is double sided otherwise single
  sided.  This appears to be non-standard so may cause problems with floppy
  controllers.

* The number of GAP bytes depends on the number of sectors on the disk.  If
  1024 byte sectors are used then the GAP value should be increased between
  each sector.

TRACK START
-----------
QTY (dec) data (hex)
32        4E (GAP)

SECTOR HEADER
-------------
8         0
3         F5 (writes A1)
1         FE (IAM)
1         TRACK
1         SIDE+1 (see Low level formatting notes)
1         SECTOR NUMBER
1         2  (sector length 0=128, 1=256, 2=512, 3=1024)
1         F7 (writes 2 CRCs)
22        4E (GAP)

DATA BLOCK
----------
12        0
3         F5
1         FB (DAM)
512       E5 (data contents, 512 bytes normally)
1         F7 (writes 2 CRCs)
31        4E (GAP)

Repeat for all sectors starting at SECTOR HEADER

END OF TRACK FILLER (ERASES OLD SECTORS/HEADERS)
------------------------------------------------
512       4E (GAP, Keep writing until the track is full)
